However, I have never noticed any out of memory exceptions or performance drains with or without this patch. I added the WeakReference as defensive code to guard against unnecessary memory usage. But this was flawed because I can\u0027t guarantee that the reference will still be there when it is needed. So, it needs to be a strong reference.",
